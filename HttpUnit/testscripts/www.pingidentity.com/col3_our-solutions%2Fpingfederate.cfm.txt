An All-in-one Internet Identity Security Solution
PingFederate performs three critical security functions that make accessing Internet applications easier and more secure:
Internet Single Sign-On (SSO)
Users sign on once to their corporate network, then PingFederate securely communicates their identities to internal and external Web-based applications. No individual application passwords are necessary and no additional logins are required, increasing user convenience and making applications more secure.
Internet User Account Management
PingFederate integrates with your corporate directory to automatically create, update and disable user accounts for Internet applications throughout the user's lifecycle. When a user leaves the organization or no longer requires application access, PingFederate immediately disables that user's account at the Internet application, ensuring that only authorized users have access to the application.
Secure Web APIs (Secure Web Services)
PingFederate?s Security Token Service allows applications to use industry standard techniques to add identity information to their API calls.
PingFederate is a complete Internet Identity Security platform delivered as on-premise software
Why choose PingFederate? Because it…
Delivers a complete Internet Identity Security solution, including Internet Single Sign-On for users accessing internal and external Web-based applications, Automated Internet User Account Management and Universal Token Translation.
Deploys in days, not months and can be installed on standard hardware. PingFederate does not require third party software, extensive custom coding, major system integration or substantial upgrade projects that other products and custom-built SSO alternatives require.
Works with what you already have by integrating with your existing identity and application infrastructures including Web application environments, custom applications, portals, Web Access Management systems, authentication systems and directories.
Increases security by eliminating application passwords in the Cloud, thus reducing the opportunity for password theft and phishing attacks. Automated Internet user account management also ensures that only authorized users have access to applications at any given point in time, further protecting valuable corporate data.
Enables compliance for the Cloud by providing a centralized, auditable point of access to Internet applications.
Audit and Compliance  Allows businesses to gain in-depth visibility into user access across on-premise and Cloud applications for security, audit reporting and compliance.
Interoperability  PingFederate was developed with open standards allowing organizations to enable Internet Identity Security in diverse IT environments including internal and web-based applications as well as Websites and portals regardless of the application platforms or access protocols. PingFederate is Liberty Certification for SAML 2.0 Interoperability.
One of PingFederate's advantages is its ability to interoperate and integrate with the systems that you already have in place. Built-in interoperability exists for ADFS 2.0, Sharepoint 2010, Visual Studio 2010, WIF/WCF, Oracle, MySQL and MS SQL Server. Integration kits, connectors, and translators are available as add-on modules.
