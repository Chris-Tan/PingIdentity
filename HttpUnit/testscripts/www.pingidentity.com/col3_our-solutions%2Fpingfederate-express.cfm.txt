PingFederate Express
PingFederate Express helps Service Providers (application owners) quickly, easily and cost-effectively establish a SAML connection with a PingFederate Identity Provider.  This Internet Single SIgn-On (SSO) "endpoint" solution delivers enterprise-class performance, reliability and security, yet it requires no additional hardware, federated identity expertise or ongoing maintenance.
PingFederate Express endpoints quickly establish a SAML connection with a PingFederate IdP.
PingFederate is the Internet identity Security platform of choice for hundreds of enterprises, government agencies, SaaS and business process outsourcing providers worldwide.  However, many of these organizations have smaller Service Provider partners, with limited IT resources, time and expertise.  For these companies, the thought of implementing even a single SAML connection to a very important partner is daunting if not impossible.
PingFederate Express solves this endpoint challenge with an Internet SSO solution that is quick, easy, and cost effective to deploy en masse, without requiring additional hardware purchases or significant time and effort on either side of the connection.
Watch PingFederate Express demonstration videos for Identity Providers and Service Providers to see how easy it is to configure and deploy PingFederate Express in minutes.
Ping Identity also has a SAML Endpoint Program that enables enterprises to obtain PingFederate Express and limited use PingFederate licenses on behalf of their endpoint partners.
